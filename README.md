# simple-K-NN-algorithm-for-regression-project

This code loads a dataset (rbsn_credit_card.csv) using Pandas, performs data splitting, and utilizes the scikit-learn library to train a K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) regression model on the data.

It splits the dataset into training and testing sets, trains the K-NN model using the training data, makes predictions on the test data, and calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a performance metric for the regression model.
